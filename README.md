## 1. The Problem

The generation of an action potential in a neuron is a complex, non-linear process. Understanding this "all-or-nothing" physiological control system is fundamental to neuroscience. The Hodgkin-Huxley model provides a mathematical framework to simulate this process, but it involves solving a set of complex differential equations.

## 2. Our Solution

For our "Medical System Modeling" course, our team (Kelompok 7) researched and analyzed the **Hodgkin-Huxley model**. We created a simulation (in MATLAB/Simulink) to model the ion channel dynamics ($Na^+$ and $K^+$ conductance) that govern the creation of an action potential.

## 3. My Role & Key Contributions

I was a **Co-author and Researcher** on this team project.

* Researched the mathematical foundations of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, including the differential equations for gating variables ($m$, $n$, $h$).
* Helped build the corresponding model in MATLAB and Simulink to replicate the physiological process.
* Analyzed the simulation outputs to verify that our model correctly reproduced the phases of an action potential (depolarization, repolarization, hyperpolarization).
* Co-authored the final research paper summarizing our findings.
